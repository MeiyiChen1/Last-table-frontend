# Welcome to Last Table ðŸ‘‹

project details(with demo video): https://www.northcoders.com/blog/last-table/

full-stack mobile application that connects spontaneous diners with restaurants looking to fill last-minute cancellations. Built by the team TypeScript Titans, the app provides a win-win platform for users seeking last-minute reservations and restaurants aiming to maximise occupancy.

Planned and delivered the app using Agile methodology, collaborating in daily stand-ups, peer programming, and sprints.
## Key Features

* Built with Expo and React Native for a smooth cross-platform mobile experience
* Used Firebase for real-time data storage, authentication, and booking updates
* Developed in TypeScript to ensure code reliability and maintainability
* Real-time availability: Users can browse available tables instantly, filtered by cuisine or restaurant name.
* Restaurant portal: Restaurants can upload new reservation slots in real-time and manage inventory seamlessly.
* User interactions: View restaurant listings, filter/search, and call directly to book a table.
* Intuitive UX: Cross-platform mobile app design using React Native and Expo for smooth navigation and fast performance.
* Backend integration: Combined Firebase Firestore (NoSQL) with a custom Express.js API for enhanced data control and scalability.
* Deployment: Frontend built with Expo; backend deployed via Render with live updates and CI/CD integration.

## Challenges overcome
* Transitioned from relying on Firebaseâ€™s backend to building a custom Express API for finer control.

* Tackled a steep learning curve with TypeScript and React Native, gaining fluency through hands-on development.

* Implemented robust code quality and version control as a team, becoming confident TypeScript developers.
